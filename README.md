# About Antama

We are a self-organized collective which was created in order to highlight the freedom of expression and to approach
social issues of a local - and not only - nature, through multifaceted actions.
All our actions are co-decided through the assembly process.
At a time when solidarity is not taken for granted, we choose to act collectively and develop zones of freedom and
creative expression.
Our purpose is the inclusion of all social groups in our action and their awareness. We are against any form of social
separation.
So we believe that the time has come to join forces and co-shape our society.
